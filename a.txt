To develop software that protects a laptop with the specified features, you'll need to create a comprehensive solution that involves both software and hardware-level integration. Here's a high-level approach to get started:

1. System Protection and Anti-Tampering
BIOS/UEFI Integration: Implement a BIOS/UEFI-level protection mechanism that can detect unauthorized system formats. Secure Boot could be a foundation here, combined with a custom firmware module.
Bootloader Protection: Design a bootloader that checks for tampering and can trigger protective measures if unauthorized access or formatting is detected.
Persistent Agent: Develop a persistent agent that reinstalls itself even after a system format, using hidden partitions or secure areas of the disk.

2. Remote Tracking and Monitoring
Location Tracking: Use GPS or Wi-Fi triangulation to track the laptop's location. Implement this in the firmware or as a persistent background service.
Remote Monitoring: Create a server-side dashboard where the owner can log in to view the location, track usage, and monitor any attempts to format or tamper with the system.

3. File Backup and Recovery
Automatic Backup: Implement a background service that periodically backs up critical files to a secure cloud service. Use encryption to protect the data during transit and storage.
Remote Backup Control: Allow the owner to initiate backup or restore operations remotely, even if the system has been compromised or formatted.

4. Subscription Management
License Verification: Include a subscription-based licensing system that checks the status periodically. If the subscription ends, the system triggers a lockdown.
System Crash on Subscription End: Develop a fail-safe mechanism that disables the system if the subscription is not renewed. This could involve encrypting the hard drive or blocking access to the operating system.

5. Implementation
Backend API: Develop a Flask or similar backend to handle remote tracking, monitoring, and backup services. This backend will communicate with the client-side agent on the laptop.
Client-Side Software: Develop a persistent software agent for the laptop that interacts with the backend, monitors system integrity, manages backups, and enforces subscription rules.
Security Measures: Ensure that the software is tamper-resistant by using techniques like code obfuscation, secure boot, and encrypted communication.

6. Testing and Deployment
Testing: Rigorously test the system for vulnerabilities, tamper-resistance, and the robustness of the tracking and backup systems.
Deployment: Provide clear instructions for installing the software on new laptops and integrating it with existing systems.

Creating a software system that fulfills the requirements youâ€™ve outlined involves multiple layers of development. While writing the entire codebase for such a system is beyond the scope of a single response, I can guide you through the process, and provide examples of how to approach each part in a simplified manner.

1. System Protection and Anti-Tampering
BIOS/UEFI Integration
BIOS/UEFI integration would typically involve working with the firmware of the laptop. This is highly specialized and typically requires collaboration with hardware manufacturers.
